<h3>RUN MACHINE IN IPL :</h3>

<p><b>KING KOHLI</b> Is One of the greatest cricketers to have ever featured in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Virat Kohli has been a constant at the Royal Challengers Bangalore ever since he was signed by the franchise as an 19-year-old back in 2008.



    Kohli is the only cricketer to feature for a single franchise for 15 consecutive seasons. He also led them between 2013-2021, and while he continued to spearhead the franchise as a batter, the 33-year-old could not lead them to the elusive title.
    
    
    
    Kohli was picked by the Bangalore franchise at a reported prize of USD$ 30,000 ahead of the inaugural edition while he was leading the Indian team in the U19 World Cup.
    
    
    
    Interestingly, the Delhi Capitals (then Daredevils) Kohli were also interested in opting for the U19 captain, but they instead went for left-arm seamer, Pradeep Sangwan.
    
    
    
    Earlier this year, Kohli recounted the same on RCB social platforms. He also described RCB picking him as an 'impactful moment' in his life. In the past three years, Kohli has time and again reiterated that he will finish his IPL career at RCB.
